# LearningCSharp
A collection of different projects which I completed as part of my A level computing course in order to learn C#.
The root folder contains all of my different projects in subdirectories as well as a Tests subdirectory in which I have written my xUnit unit tests.
I have also used github actions in order to automatically test all pushes and merged pull requests.
If you would for some strange reason like to download this code yourself you should just be able to clone it and use it in an IDE of your choosing.
I am using VScode to edit it but it should work in any IDE.
