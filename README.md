List tasks
Skills required: 
Iteration
Selection 
By reference
In-place 
Timing 

Examples: https://github.com/st-pauls-school/csharp/blob/master/ListUtilities/ListConsole/Program.cs 

The point of the first two questions is to practice iteration and selection, not to use the built in function. 

Given a list of integers - without using built in list functions - return: 
the sum 
the max element 
the min element
a list of the negative elements in the array
Build a function that, given two lists of integers, returns a boolean to say if they contain the same items (order is not important, nor are any duplicates). 
Search a sorted list (without using built in functions)
Implement a “naive” search, which just loops over the list and returns true if the given item is in the list 
Create a binary search function (as opposed to a linear search function) to return a bool to answer if a given item is in the list.

From this point on, you can use whatever methods you like.
 
Given an unsorted list of signed integers, return a list of all the integers that are duplicated in the list. 
Building on Q2, build a function that takes two lists and returns a Boolean if one list is a subset of the other list
Reverse a list, in-place.
We will, later in the course, be discussing sorting in much greater detail. But for now, implement a sort algorithm, you can use wikipedia: 
(not Bubble), although insertion or selection are ok
But quick, shell, merge or something with average complexity better than O(n2) would be better
